Interpretation:  
  For our project, we want to started off with investigating the most frequently asked legal questions subcategories so we can define a most common question type based on the data set we have at hand and use it as the theme of our research question. 

  Based on our side way bar chart, it is clear to see that out of the top 15 subcategories, among the top three categories of questions asked by clients on the online platform, two of them are related to divorce.The question of subcategory Family/Divorce/Custody has the highest frequency among the top 15, and it has been asked by almost twice as many clients than the second subcategory of others, which is showing that the divorce related questions should be treated with more preparation when it comes to training volunteers.  

  This is intriguing to us as it begs for answers to the questions such as: "What are the major determinants of divorce?","Do the clients' backgrounds affect their tendency to ask divorce related question on the ABA online platform?", and most importantly, "How do we prepare our volunteers to address these divorce related questions?"

# COMMENTS

Daniel: 
- It appears that our model 1 is the most accurate since it has the lowest AIC.
- I think we can only use 1 model for viz 2 and viz 3, otherwise our pdf page count is more than 8 pages.
- For viz 2, it might be better to look at the number of divorces per the population because as we'd expect, states with a large population would have more divorce related questions.

- Also a bit weird that state like California and Idaho don't have any divorce related questions. I think thats because when we filtered the subcategories, those states don't have any subcategories with "Divorce". I don't know how we'd account for that... but we might need to so Prince doesn't mark us off.

Daniel: 
- We might need to remove the StateAbbr "US"??? Billy: Prolly
- Actually we might not need to remove StateAbbr "US". Looking at the instructions PDF, is says that the "US" is a category for immigrants and veterans. So while its not a state in itself, still might be important to keep??

   
  
   
Comment by Billy: WHAT we need to finish today
- The AIC is alarmingly high
- Some assumptions to consider for our model
  - observations are independent
  Things we have to do: 
  - no sever multicollinearity among explanatory variables, no highly correlated
    variables
  - no extreme outliers
  - Remove independent variables with collinealarity
  - logit model, the default should be binomial 
  - Explaining why we use AIC BIC
  - Check accuracy of model 
  - Suggestion based on limitations , missing data = limitation
  - Confidence interval 
  -  Do the residual analysis to check for accuracy only for our best model.
